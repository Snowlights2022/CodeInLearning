# My code in Learning
This repo comes from a undergraduate major in electronnical engineering and automation.
For this reason, this repo mostly is used to store c,c#,matlab(maybe?) and python files,sometimes may be used to transport some file of  my classes,etc.ZIP files are encrypted, because they are non-public(or maybe they are not belong to me).
This repo will be pubilc after I mastered how to use git fluently.
May this guy do well.
